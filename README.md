# SDKMAN! for fish

Provides auto-completion for [SDKMAN!] and adds installed binaries to the PATH.

## Install

With [fisherman] (install separately):

```
fisher reitzig/sdkman-for-fish
```

## Usage

It's all in the background; you should be able to run `sdk` and binaries installed
with `sdk` as you would expect.
